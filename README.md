## Welcome to data.ocean-sampling-day.org

This environment is maintained by [the open science team](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci) of [VLIZ](http://vliz.be/) to publish the managed data of [Ocean-Sampling-Day](https://github.com/ocean-sampling-day/)

[Ocean Sampling Day](https://www.assembleplus.eu/research/ocean-sampling-day) is a simultaneous worldwide research campaign where marine biologists around the globe participate in sampling of the worldâ€™s oceans. OSD was launched by the [MicroB3](https://www.microb3.eu/) project on the summer solstice, 21 June 2014, and [ASSEMBLE Plus](https://www.assembleplus.eu) took on OSD coordination in 2018. The OSD campaign is supported by [European Marine Biological Resource Centre](https://www.embrc.eu/), and is coordinate by the [Hellenic Centre for Marine Research](https://www.hcmr.gr/en/) (HCMR) in Heraklion, Crete, who also received and processed all the samples, extracting and sequencing the eDNA in order to detect all prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 

The currently available datasets are:
* [Ocean Sampling Day 2014](/OSD2014/): these data were collected and managed by MicroB3 and are published on [PANGAEA](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.854419);  a copy is provided here 
* [Ocean Sampling Day 2018](/OSD2018/): these data were collected and managed by ASSEMBLE Plus and are managed here
* [Ocean Sampling Day 2019](/OSD2019/): these data were collected and managed by ASSEMBLE Plus and are managed here

This is very much work in progress. More will follow.
